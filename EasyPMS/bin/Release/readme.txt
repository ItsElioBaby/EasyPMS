Since you're reading this you're probably part of my "beta team" testing EasyPMS.

This program is pretty much straight forward, you wanna manage your shop? Keep your stock safe? Perhaps you're a social engineer and want to keep track of your requests? View shop analysis in real time? Well EasyPMS is here for all of these needs.


During this beta testing (of a week, which ends on 15 August 2016) you're most likely going to:
- Test software stability.
- Give feedback and ideas to make the program better.

What's gonna change once the software is ready for release:
- I will finish the Search/Delete [Specific queue items based on their added date].
- You're probably gonna be a better man.
- License format.


Let's have fun! Skype me: elio.decolli !
